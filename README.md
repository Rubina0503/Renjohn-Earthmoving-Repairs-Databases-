# Renjohn-Earthmoving-Repairs-Databases-
Renjohn Earthmoving Repairs is established as a modest sized company that provides on the repairs, modifications and remanufacturing of parts required by earthmoving vehicles, aircraft, and a variety of engines. The company prides itself on part quality, the highly skilful staff being employed and most importantly customer satisfaction. Abiding to these principles, Renjohn elevated to leader in the field whilst only being comprised of a single workshop and several staff.
However, recently a data leak occurred in the company’s database, resulting in sensitive information being exposed to unauthorized parties and important details describing the various orders and parts had become corrupted. Reportedly this occurred due to a variety of data being housed in a single table, which later became unstable due to irresponsible database management. Considering the information given, an Entity Relation Diagram (ERD) has been developed to prepare and plan an improved model of the database, allocating data to appropriate tables as well as a multitude of security improvements. A larger scale version of the ERD is provided on the following page. We used Microsoft SQL Server to manage the business database, and I was responsible for designing the database and populating it with data.
